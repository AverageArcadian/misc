Greetings, 
This is free, so edit it yourself, and enjoy

These are the things I'd look into updating according to yuor needs:
- Drafting standard (currently AS1100-1992)
- Add your companyy name or logo to black area in title block
- Confirm your font meets your drafting standard (I am using Franklin Gothic)

Also:
- when adding an addition to the revision table just double click the table and press "add addition" and it will automatically update the revision sequence in teh title block
- some properties are linked to model, some are manually inputted (finish, document type, drawing number)

Yours faithfully,
